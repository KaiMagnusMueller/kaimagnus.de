Destinations is an application concept that simplifies the design process of wayfinding systems. It maps the complete design process, which is currently dominated by manual work. Destinations lets users view a digital representation of a project site, visually plan visitor routes, sign placements and messages. 

During this project, we analyzed the design process in detail, spoke with designers and discovered pain points they come in contact with during their work. 

Based on our findings, we designed an improved workflow and data model from the ground up. Destinations uses the potential of a digital application to bring greater flexibility, speed and features like live updates.

In Destinations, users can load building data to explore and analyze. From there on, designers can simulate visitors, traffic flows and create routes for their wayfinding system. They can then use those routes to create information sequences and signage. Finally, tools to insert data into designs and simulation complete the process.
