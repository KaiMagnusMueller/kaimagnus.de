Wires is a prototyping app for macOS. It aims to bridge screen design and hardware prototyping. Patch based programming of inputs and outputs makes combining them with screens or buttons designed in Sketch as easy as possible.

Being a designer means to gather and create ideas and connect them in new ways while maintaining a strategic working process. My main motivation is essentially about grasping and understanding any kind of topic no matter the size. Synthesizing findings into great products, concepts and visions is one of my greatest joys.
