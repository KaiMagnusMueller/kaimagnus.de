Being a designer means to gather and create ideas and connect them in new ways while maintaining a strategic working process. My main motivation is essentially about grasping and understanding any kind of topic no matter the complexity. Synthesizing findings into great products, concepts and visions is one of my greatest joys. 

## Working

Sheets of paper are my number one tool, starting from big and broad strokes until I reach the smallest details. Digitally, I mainly work with Sketch and the Adobe Creative Cloud. For bigger projects I automate my workflow with tools like [Data Populator][DataPop] and for special occasions, I don't shy away from the occasional line of code.
