It's time for a new Website.

After coming Back from my Small Break during winter to take a break after studying and where I took a few steps away from our project, no we decided it's the right time to get serious about our project's presentation and show it to the outside world. 

Directly after we officially finished our project at the University, and tried to recruit more team members for our project, I developed a small website to show and explain what our project is about and what our thoughts were while developing it. We also wanted to have a platform for news, announcements and new developments, that would help us getting the attention other people and make them interested in working with us. The design was done rather quick with a walk-through in the center and a few major features for support, not unlike a standard product page. 

My first version of our website served it's purpose but now we wanted to take it a step further and start to think about an actual identity. 


## Finding a Design Direction

Our first versions' design was more more or less based on our final presentation with a dark background and blue outlines for elements in the front, although I adapted the design and added a few features.

We first started exploring other existing product pages and identities, which I arranged on two axis to better understand the space that we are operating in and where we want to be.

caption: "A lot of product pages operate in the bottom left - unemotional and fairly standard - quadrant." %}

At this point we are three designers working together, so we wanted to position our product in the upper left quadrant to play a bit more into our strengths of communication and design.

To narrow down our options, we conducted a dot vote. Throughout the next few weeks, we started working separately on our own concepts and presented them to each other every Saturday. This way we could save time and produce more varied concepts.

After a few weeks of iteration, it became clear that we favorited a bright design with one major foreground color and thin dark borders. During this time we merged our Explorations and started working on one Main concept. 

## The New Site

It's the final result.

## Development

Development of our new website was led by me, with additional work done by Johanna Wellnitz. The site is based on the template engine Jekyll with plain JavaScript for handling the message pop up and it's states. Personal premiere was using PHP for our message delivery backend. 

The Project can be found on [GitHub][GHLink].

It was a quite smooth experience developing the website, building new parts and having my progress deployed live on github pages was nice to see. It was very fun To see Johanna Helping out and checking in some changes, and then discussing them with pull requests in the evenings. While leading the development of this page came naturally because I was also the main contributor, I started to assign my teammates some tasks to help me out Like testing, writing texts, designing favicons and so on. 

> Almost naturally, we got into an asynchronous working process, powered by leaving each other comments on our designs.

Almost naturally, we got into an asynchronous working process, powered by leaving each other comments on our designs. Mainly because of our different schedules during the working week.
