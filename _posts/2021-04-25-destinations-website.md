It's time for a new Website.

After coming Back from my Small Break during winter to take a break after studying and where I took a few steps away from our project, no we decided it's the right time to get serious about our project's presentation and show it to the outside world.

Directly after we officially finished our project at the University, and tried to recruit more team members for our project, I developed a small website to show and explain what our project is about and what our thoughts were while developing it. We also wanted to have a platform for news, announcements and new developments, that would help us getting the attention other people and make them interested in working with us. The design was done rather quick with a walk-through in the center and a few major features for support, not unlike a standard product page.

My first version of our website served it's purpose but now we wanted to take it a step further and start to think about an actual identity.
