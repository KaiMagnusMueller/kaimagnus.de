Back in February, I wrote a post at our [Destinations website] about winning the goAward.  The award was initiated last year to celebrate exceptional projects developed at our university and to give teams further motivation and resources for their development. 

This week, we finally got to attend the ceremony held at the in:it[^1] co-working space in Schwäbisch Gmünd. The ceremony was originally announced back in April but got delayed due to the rising Covid cases in Germany. The ceremony itself was kept simple with a low number of attendees. Aside from the six winning teams, there were some representatives from the university, the city, the local Chamber of Crafts and the local startup initiative. Every team got a certificate and said a few words, it took around half an hour until all teams were finished. 

It was good to see some familiar faces and other likeminded people again to chat about our project and get some feedback. The atmosphere was great and we started brainstorming ideas before we even knew it and definitely got a couple new impulses and ideas that we want to explore.
