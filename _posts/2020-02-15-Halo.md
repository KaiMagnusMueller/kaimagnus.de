## Introduction

Today, internet research is a fundamental part of any research. There are countless resources for any kind of topic and levels of complexity from simple overviews to academic literature. Wikipedia usually serves as a first entrypoint with the goal to get to know a topic and technical jargon. 

From there on, technical terms can be used in search engines to explore the topic in more detail until research is done. In this case we are conducting focused research on a known topic or problem.

> Not everything that is found was searched for

Users can also consume content passively when they are not looking for something specific. Reading online news or listening to podcasts can be sources for information as well. This information might not be interesting on its own but users might recall them later when they become relevant.

Research can be done almost completely in the browser today. Searching and finding content being the most important part but saving and citing can be done in office web apps as well. Additionally, browsers allow to open multiple pages with tabs and categorize content with bookmarks. 

Especially during long research processes tabs can become confusing to users when they are unable to remember the connections between tabs and which link led to what page. 

History and bookmarks help to save information and to find it again but the history does not show any relationships between entries and bookmarks have to be manually updated.



## Design Sprint

After our research and sprint, we defined requirements for our project:

1. Keep track of research phases and view connections
2. Free and fast exploration of content without fear of losing information
3. Review explored content
4. Save important quotes for later use

## Serendipity in Computing

> How do we enable serendipity in a digital interface?

1. Support reflection and the creation of mental connections
2. Adjust to the changing importance of information
3. Be relaxing and serene
4. Reduce amount of information and feeling of being overwhelmed, prevent disorientation
