## Introduction

{% comment %}
Today, internet research is a fundamental part of any research. There are countless resources for any kind of topic and levels of complexity from simple overviews to academic literature. Wikipedia usually serves as a first entrypoint with the goal to get to know a topic and technical jargon. 

From there on, technical terms can be used in search engines to explore the topic in more detail until research is done. In this case we are conducting focused research on a known topic or problem.

> Not everything that is found was searched for

Users can also consume content passively when they are not looking for something specific. Reading online news or listening to podcasts can be sources for information as well. This information might not be interesting on its own but users might recall them later when they become relevant.

Today, internet research is a fundamental part of any research. There are countless resources for any kind of topic and levels of complexity from simple overviews to academic literature. Apart from searching and finding content, other related tasks can be done completely in the browser as well. Saving and citing for example can be done in Google Docs and content can be sorted with bookmark tools like Pocket.

Especially during long research processes - and after opening a lot of different pages or tabs - users start to become overwhelmed. This happens when they are unable to remember the connections between tabs and which link led to what page. Features like browser history and bookmarks help to find and save information. However, they can not show the relationships between history entries and bookmarks have to be manually updated. 

Since the introduction of 'tabbed browsing', there have been no big developments that would to an improvement of this situation. There have been a few smaller features like icons for unread tabs, 'read later' lists or services like Pocket, where users can assign tags to websites they save.

Today, internet research is a fundamental part of any research. There are countless resources for any kind of topic and levels of complexity from simple overviews to academic literature. 

Especially during long research processes - and after opening a lot of different pages or tabs - however, users can start to become overwhelmed. This happens when they are unable to remember the connections between tabs, which link led to what page and what information they found where. To help users find and save important information browsers have features like history and bookmarks. However, they can not show the relationships between history entries and bookmarks have to be manually updated. 

It is time to find a new approach to internet research. In this project, we want to analyze web-browsers and their components, study the research process and user behavior. It is our goal to create a user-centered redesign of the browser as an application that is optimized for research.


## User Research

To learn more about how our users typically research we conducted interviews. 

When our interviewees start researching, they usually follow the same pattern. First, interesting Information is collected by opening links in new tabs. They mention not wanting to lose sight of the previous pages. This process is repeated until enough interesting information is collected to start reviewing. To save information, a variety of apps to create notes or documents is used. Others use their group chat to save links as well. A method, they admit, that involves lots of scrolling. 

Our interview partners repeatedly mention the fear of losing information. Sometimes, they close tabs or whole windows and have to go look for them in the history. When researching multiple topics at the same time, they report having trouble to keep them apart.

> How would a browser built for research look like?


## Design Sprint

Next, we started a design sprint for rapid prototyping and experiments.

    caption="Our first prototype based on initial research. Links are opened in descending order in the background and highlighted content can be saved in the right sidebar." %}

We then showed this 

After our research and sprint, we defined requirements for our project:

1. Keep track of research phases and view connections
2. Free and fast exploration of content without fear of losing information
3. Review explored content
4. Save important quotes for later use

## Serendipity in Computing

> How do we enable serendipity in a digital interface?

1. Support reflection and the creation of mental connections
2. Adjust to the changing importance of information
3. Be relaxing and serene
4. Reduce amount of information and feeling of being overwhelmed, prevent disorientation
